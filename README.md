# Project_Customer-Success-Co-Pilot
 
**Customer Success Co-pilot**

This project serves as the culmination of a 9-week data analytics bootcamp with IronHack.

**Project Brief** 

 **Case Study 1 - Data Science End to End Project** 
 
 The goal is to build a predictive model in Python on top of a chosen business case. The project encompasses the entire data science 
 process, including:

* Data collection 
* Data cleaning and wrangling 
* Exploratory data analysis 
* Feature engineering 
* Preprocessing 
* Model selection and evaluation  
    Models to explore:
      * Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks (utilizing Google Colab for computational reasons)
* Data visualization 

The project is structured as a complete pipeline that includes every step of the process.

**Source Data** 
* Inspiration: Point 15 in Interview Query: https://www.interviewquery.com/p/classification-projects
* Data source: Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pashupatigupta/emotion-detection-from-text/data
  Includes 40,000 tweets, each tagged with an emotion

**Problem Type**
This project addresses a (multi-)classification problem wherein the goal is to classify the emotion of a given text from a selection of emotions. 

**Business Case** 

  **Mission**
  
  The mission is to enable customer success managers to better prioritize their workload through a more rapid understanding of customer   
  sentiment.

  Initially, the concept of customer success focused mainly on reducing churn and maximizing revenue. However, it has evolved into a   
  comprehensive strategy for building strong relationships with customers, ensuring their success, and becoming their trusted partner.

  The average salary of a customer success manager (CSM) in Germany is €74,192 with an average annual bonus of €5,038. Factoring in employer   taxes, that’s an annual investment of €95K per year per customer success manager.

  Given the substantial cost of this resource, companies need to maximize efficiency, particularly in the context of a challenging   
  fundraising environment. Across the tech space, with the backdrop of mass layoffs, customer success managers are being asked to do more 
  with less and need to be masters of prioritization.

  Introducing: The Customer Success Co-pilot: the tool that enables better understanding of customer sentiment and workload prioritization.

**Project Overview**

The Customer Success Co-pilot project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to revolutionize the way customer success managers prioritize their workload.

**Key Technologies**

 * Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Our project utilizes advanced NLP techniques to analyze and understand the sentiment of customer feedback.
NLP algorithms process large volumes of text data from customer reviews to extract valuable insights.
By employing NLP, we can automatically categorize customer sentiments, enabling faster decision-making and workload prioritization.

* Machine Learning:

The heart of our project lies in Machine Learning algorithms that learn from data to make predictions.
We explore various Machine Learning models such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks to classify customer sentiments.
These models are trained on a dataset of 40,000 tweets, each tagged with an emotion, to accurately predict the emotions of customer reviews.
Machine Learning empowers our tool, The Customer Success Co-pilot, to provide actionable insights for customer success managers.

* Significance

By integrating NLP and Machine Learning, we provide an innovative solution to address the challenges faced by customer success managers in prioritizing their workload.
Our project showcases the power of advanced technologies in enhancing decision-making processes and improving efficiency in customer-centric roles.

The incorporation of NLP and Machine Learning underscores our commitment to leveraging state-of-the-art techniques to drive impactful business outcomes.
